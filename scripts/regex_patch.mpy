### This is a patch for Regex Replace issue of MadEdit
#The issue is hard to fix, so, use this workarond, remove the '#' 
#before the InsertStr if you want to replace the space

#Create MadEdit Object for active edit
medit = MadEdit()

#Restore caret position
medit.SetCaretPosition(0) #Move caret/cursor to the begeinning of the file
#Search a space char that was between two none space chars
while medit.FindTextNext("(?<=.)\s(?=.)", True, False, False, False, -1, -1) == -1:
    medit.Delete()  #delete the space char if found
