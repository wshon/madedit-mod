Mod v0.3.8
1.New: Upgrade boost to 1.59
2.New: Silent mode which can be used in scripting(Only file names would be passed to
     running instance in single instance mode)
     Run MadEdit-Mod without show GUI and use a MadPython to handle the files to
     be opened. So, you can use the Astyle/XML formatter/HTML tools the same as 
     the original ones, eg, call it in a script to handle a lot of files.
     Furthermore, you can use MadPython to do more!!!
     [-h], help, Displays help on the command line parameters
     [-f], force, Edit and save file ignoring the ReadOnly flag(For the files in command line)

     [-m], madpython, Specify MadPython file to be run on the file
     [-r], recursive, Recursively run on files of subdirectories
     [-w], wildcard, Enable wildcard support in file name\n(line number would be disabled because it used '*')
